# SDWebImage + Concorde = Progressive JPEG

The recent refactoring of SDWebImage (4.2.0) allows pluginable coders. 
A good example of using this feature is supporting Progressive JPEG.
Take a look at this example where Concorde is plugged in SDWebImage coders.

## How to run the demo

1. Clone this repo (or just download)
2. Run `pod install`
3. Stop! Hammertime
4. Open SDWebImageProgressiveJPEGDemo.xcworkspace, build and run
